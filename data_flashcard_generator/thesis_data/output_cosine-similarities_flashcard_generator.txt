Document: ('https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure', '51975', 'In computer science, a data structure is the organization and implementation of values and information. In simple words, it is the way of organizing information in a computer so that it can be more easily understood and worked with. Data structures are different from abstract data types in the way they are used. Data structures are the implementations of abstract data types in a concrete and physical setting. They do this by using algorithms. This can be seen in the relationship between the list (abstract data type) and the linked list (data structure). A list contains a sequence of values or bits of information. A linked list also has a “pointer” or “reference” between each node of information that points to the next item and the previous one. This allows one to go forwards or backwards in the list. Furthermore, data structures are often optimized for certain operations. Finding the best data structure when solving a problem is an important part of programming. Data structure is a systematic way to store data\n\nBasic data structures\n\nArray\nThe simplest type of data structure is a linear array. Also known as a one-dimensional array. An array holds several values of the same type (Integer, Floats, String, etc.). Accessing elements within the array is very fast. An array is normally of fixed size. After the size of the array is defined at the start, it may not be possible to increase the size of the array without creating a new larger array and copying all values into the new array. In\xa0computer science, an\xa0array data structure\xa0or simply an\xa0array\xa0is a\xa0data structure\xa0consisting of a collection of\xa0elements\xa0(values\xa0or\xa0variables), each identified by at least one\xa0array index\xa0or\xa0key. An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index\xa0tuple by a mathematical formula.\n\nFor example, an array of 10 integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10\xa0words\xa0at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, 2036, so that the element with index\xa0i\xa0has the address 2000 + 4 ×\xa0i.\n\nAs the mathematical concept of a\xa0matrix\xa0can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the term "vector" is used in computing to refer to an array, although\xa0tuples\xa0rather than\xa0vectors\xa0are the more correct mathematical equivalent. Arrays are often used to implement\xa0tables, especially\xa0look up tables; the word\xa0table\xa0is sometimes used as a synonym of\xa0array.\n\nArrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They can also be used to implement many other data structures, such as\xa0lists\xa0and\xa0strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many\xa0external storage\xa0devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses.\xa0Processors, especially\xa0vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.\n\nArrays are useful because the element indices can be computed at\xa0run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative\xa0statement\xa0to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually,\xa0but not always, fixed while the array is in use.\n\nThe term\xa0array\xa0is often used to mean\xa0array data type, a kind of\xa0data type\xa0provided by most\xa0high-level programming languages\xa0that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by\xa0hash tables,\xa0linked lists,\xa0search trees, or other data structures.\n\nLinked list\nA\xa0linked data structure\xa0is a set of\xa0information/data\xa0linked together by\xa0references. The data are often called nodes. The references are often called links or pointers. From here on, the words node and pointer will be used for these concepts.\n\nIn linked data structures, pointers are only\xa0dereferenced\xa0or compared for equality. Thus, linked data structures are different than\xa0arrays, which require adding and subtracting pointers.\n\nLinked lists,\xa0search trees,\xa0and expression trees are all linked data structures. They are also important in algorithms such as\xa0topological sort\xa0and\xa0set union-find.\n\nStack\n\nA stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack. The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a stack of plates or books where you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things from it. This structure is used all throughout programming.')

Document: ('https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20mining', '49697', 'Data mining is a term from computer science. Sometimes it is also called knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Data mining is about finding new information in a lot of data. The information obtained from data mining is hopefully both new and useful. \n\nIn many cases, data is stored so it can be used later. The data is saved with a goal. For example, a store wants to save what has been bought. They want to do this to know how much they should buy themselves, to have enough to sell later. Saving this information, makes a lot of data. The data is usually saved in a database. The reason why data is saved is called the first use. \n\nLater, the same data can also be used to get other information that was not needed for the first use. The store might want to know now what kind of things people buy together when they buy at the store. (Many people who buy pasta also buy mushrooms for example.) That kind of information is in the data, and is useful, but was not the reason why the data was saved. This information is new and can be useful. It is a second use for the same data. \n\nFinding new information that can also be useful from data, is called data mining.\n\nDifferent kinds of data mining \nFor data, there a lot of different kinds of data mining for getting new information. Usually, prediction is involved. There is uncertainty in the predicted results. The following is based on the observation that there is a small green apple in which we can adjust our data in structural manner. Some of the kinds of data mining are: \n Pattern recognition (Trying to find similarities in the rows in the database, in the form of rules. Small -> green. (Small apples are often green))\n Using a Bayesian network (Trying to make something that can say how the different data attributes are connected/influence each other. The size and the colour are related. So if you know something about the size, you can guess the colour.)\n Using a Neural network (Trying to make a model like a brain, which is hard to understand, but a computer can tell that if the apple is green it has a higher chance to be sour, if we tell the computer the apple is green. So this is like a black box model, we do not know how it works, but it works.) \n Using Classification tree (With all other knowledge trying to say what one other thing about the thing we are looking at will be. Here is an apple with a size, a colour and shininess, what will it taste like?)\n\nComputer science')

Document: ('https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics', '13473', 'Bioinformatics or computational biology is the study of large amounts of biological information or genome. It focuses on molecules like DNA. It is done often with the help of computers.\n\nFoundation\nAs species of living things change over time, the DNA contained in their cells change, because of evolution. If we can extract the information from living things today, and compare them to each other, we can see which living things are most closely related, the most similar can be thought to be the most closely related in time. Biologists can then construct family trees, or phylogenies. By combining each tree, a grand tree connecting all living things can be made, this is called the "Tree of Life". Bioinformatics uses integration of mathematical, statistical and computational method to analyze biological, biochemical and biophysical data.\n\nThe process\nAll of the information needed by a cell is provided in its DNA. When a cell wants to build a protein, it finds the appropriate piece of DNA, makes a copy of it (called RNA), and uses the instructions in the copy to make the protein. \n\nProteins can perform many functions like transportation, structural support, movement and metabolism. Proteins are made from amino acids. There are twenty different amino acids that are used to build millions of different protein molecules. \n\nThese molecules can be studied using computers to analyze the DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequences from which they are created. Because there are so many different molecules, the best way we have of understanding how the entire system works is to use bioinformatics.\n\nComputers in bioinformatics\nChemists have developed ways to understand the shape and behavior of small molecules, using mathematical analysis. They might use computers to study these molecules. The DNA contained in just one cell of an organism is far too large to be read by any person, and to compare the DNA between two (or more) organisms, be they in the brother and sister, or of a completely different species, requires comparing large amounts of information to find differences. Computers are better suited to such comparisons, and computer programmers have worked with biologists to create very very large databases to store all the DNA information that has ever been learned.\n\nRelated pages\nSequence analysis\n\nBranches of biology\nComputer science')

Document: ('https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information', '3609', 'The word "information" is used in many different ways. Originally, it comes from a word that meant to give a form to something. Information  is something that people can learn, know about, or understand. For example, a newspaper contains information about the world. This article contains information about "Information".\n\nInformation in computer science \nPeople who use computers often use the words information and data in the same way. There are special fields of study called "information science", "information technology" (IT), and data science.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, some people gave a new, specific meaning to "information". At that time, the first computer databases were built. In computer science, data often means a kind of information that has not been checked.

A person can trust that "information" is correct.\n\nInformation can only be correct and good enough to trust if there are very good and complete ways to check the data (data checking, validation or verification) and decide it is good enough (acceptance process).

Also, computers may take too much time to finish long tasks. For example, it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA - so instead a computer will try to make a close guess. A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster.\n\nAnswering the question \nAlgorithms are a specific set of instructions or steps on how to complete a task. For example, a computer scientist wants to sort playing cards. There are many ways to sort them - by suits (diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades) or by numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace).  By deciding on a set of steps to sort the cards, the scientist has created an algorithm. The scientist then needs to test whether this algorithm works. This shows how well and how fast the algorithm sorts cards.\n\nA simple but slow algorithm is: pick up two cards and check whether they are sorted correctly. If they are not, reverse them. Then do it again with another two, and repeat them all until they are all sorted. This "bubble sort" method will work, but it will take a very long time.\n \nA better algorithm is: find the first card with the smallest suit and smallest number (2 of diamonds), and place it at the start. After this, look for the second card, and so on. This algorithm is much faster, and does not need much space. This algorithm is a "selection sort".\n\nAda Lovelace wrote the first computer algorithm in 1843, for a computer that was never finished. Computers began during World War II.
