0;What is the primary goal of data science in relation to the data it extracts knowledge from?;The primary goal of data science is to extract useful knowledge from the data.;Data science is the study of the extraction of knowledge from data. It uses various techniques from many fields, including signal processing, mathematics, probability, machine learning, computer programming, statistics, data engineering, pattern matching, and data visualization, with the goal of extracting useful knowledge from the data. With computer systems able to handle more data, big data is an important aspect of data science.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20science;The primary goal of data science is to extract useful knowledge from data.;1;0,951947891;1;1;0,999354271;0,999838568;0,333333332;1;1;0,999173224;yes
1;What skills do data scientists typically use to solve complicated data problems?;Mathematics, statistics, and computer science;A person that does data science is called a data scientist. Data scientists solve complicated data problems using mathematics, statistics and computer science, although very good skill in these subjects are not required. However, a data scientist is most likely to be an expert in only one or two of these disciplines, meaning that cross disciplinary teams can be a key component of data science.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20science;A data scientist typically uses mathematics, statistics, and computer science.;1;0,965302567;1;1;0,891696821;0,972924205;0,999999998;1;1;0,754769742;yes

3;What is the primary function of a data structure in computer science?;The primary function of a data structure is to organize information in a computer so that it can be more easily understood and worked with.;In computer science, a data structure is the organization and implementation of values and information. In simple words, it is the way of organizing information in a computer so that it can be more easily understood and worked with. Data structures are different from abstract data types in the way they are used. Data structures are the implementations of abstract data types in a concrete and physical setting. They do this by using algorithms. This can be seen in the relationship between the list (abstract data type) and the linked list (data structure). A list contains a sequence of values or bits of information. A linked list also has a “pointer” or “reference” between each node of information that points to the next item and the previous one. This allows one to go forwards or backwards in the list. Furthermore, data structures are often optimized for certain operations. Finding the best data structure when solving a problem is an important part of programming. Data structure is a systematic way to store data;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure;The primary function of a data structure in computer science is to organize and implement values and information in a way that makes it easier to understand and work with on a computer.;1;0,97857521;1;1;0,974562001;0,8436405;0,799999998;1;1;0,950169444;yes
4;What is the primary characteristic of the elements stored in an array data structure?;The elements in an array are of the same type, such as Integer, Floats, or String.;The simplest type of data structure is a linear array. Also known as a one-dimensional array. An array holds several values of the same type (Integer, Floats, String, etc.). Accessing elements within the array is very fast. An array is normally of fixed size. After the size of the array is defined at the start, it may not be possible to increase the size of the array without creating a new larger array and copying all values into the new array. In computer science, an array data structure or simply an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure;The elements stored in an array can hold several values of the same type like integer, floats, string, etc.;1;0,862813169;1;1;0,916060962;0,829015241;0;1;1;0,87590003;yes
5;How are elements in an array stored in memory, and what determines their memory address?;Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, and the memory address of each element is determined by the base address plus the product of the index and the size of each element.;For example, an array of 10 integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + 4 × i.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure;"Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, with their memory address determined by the base address of the array plus the size of each element multiplied by the element's index; for example, in an array of 10 integers with a base address of 2000, the element with index i would have the address 2000 + 4 × i (e.g., indices 0 through 9 would be stored at addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036).";1;0,95844724;1;1;0,97195434;0,805488585;0,230769231;1;1;0,873110175;yes

8;What is a key benefit of using arrays in data structures, and how does it impact the processing of elements?;A key benefit of using arrays is that element indices can be computed at run time, allowing a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array.;Arrays are useful because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure;A key benefit of arrays in terms of processing elements is that their indices can be computed at run time, allowing a single iterative statement to efficiently process many elements.;1;0,932741159;1;1;0,977256188;0,994314047;0,399999999;1;1;0,961701214;yes
