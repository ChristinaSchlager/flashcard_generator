0;What is the primary goal of data science in relation to the data it extracts knowledge from?;The primary goal of data science is to extract useful knowledge from the data.;['Data science is the study of the extraction of knowledge from data. It uses various techniques from many fields, including signal processing, mathematics, probability, machine learning, computer programming, statistics, data engineering, pattern matching, and data visualization, with the goal of extracting useful knowledge from the data.

3;What is the primary function of a data structure in computer science?;The primary function of a data structure is to organize information in a computer so that it can be more easily understood and worked with.;['In computer science, a data structure is the organization and implementation of values and information. In simple words, it is the way of organizing information in a computer so that it can be more easily understood and worked with. Data structures are different from abstract data types in the way they are used. Data structures are the implementations of abstract data types in a concrete and physical setting. They do this by using algorithms. This can be seen in the relationship between the list (abstract data type) and the linked list (data structure). A list contains a sequence of values or bits of information. A linked list also has a “pointer” or “reference” between each node of information that points to the next item and the previous one. This allows one to go forwards or backwards in the list. Furthermore, data structures are often optimized for certain operations. Finding the best data structure when solving a problem is an important part of programming. Data structure is a systematic way to store data'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure
4;What is the primary characteristic of the elements stored in an array data structure?;The elements in an array are of the same type, such as Integer, Floats, or String.;['The simplest type of data structure is a linear array. Also known as a one-dimensional array. An array holds several values of the same type (Integer, Floats, String, etc.). Accessing elements within the array is very fast. An array is normally of fixed size. After the size of the array is defined at the start, it may not be possible to increase the size of the array without creating a new larger array and copying all values into the new array. In\xa0computer science, an\xa0array data structure\xa0or simply an\xa0array\xa0is a\xa0data structure\xa0consisting of a collection of\xa0elements\xa0(values\xa0or\xa0variables), each identified by at least one\xa0array index\xa0or\xa0key. An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index\xa0tuple by a mathematical formula.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure
5;How are elements in an array stored in memory, and what determines their memory address?;Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, and the memory address of each element is determined by the base address plus the product of the index and the size of each element.;['For example, an array of 10 integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10\xa0words\xa0at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, 2036, so that the element with index\xa0i\xa0has the address 2000 + 4 ×\xa0i.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure
6;What is another term sometimes used to refer to two-dimensional arrays in computing?;Matrices;"['As the mathematical concept of a\xa0matrix\xa0can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the term ""vector"" is used in computing to refer to an array, although\xa0tuples\xa0rather than\xa0vectors\xa0are the more correct mathematical equivalent. Arrays are often used to implement\xa0tables, especially\xa0look up tables; the word\xa0table\xa0is sometimes used as a synonym of\xa0array.']";https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure
7;What is unique about how arrays interact with computer memory?;Arrays effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers, and in most modern computers, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses.;['Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They can also be used to implement many other data structures, such as\xa0lists\xa0and\xa0strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many\xa0external storage\xa0devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses.\xa0Processors, especially\xa0vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure
8;What is a key benefit of using arrays in data structures, and how does it impact the processing of elements?;A key benefit of using arrays is that element indices can be computed at run time, allowing a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array.;['Arrays are useful because the element indices can be computed at\xa0run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative\xa0statement\xa0to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually,\xa0but not always, fixed while the array is in use.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure
9;What is the primary function of an array data type in high-level programming languages?;An array data type consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time.;"['The term\xa0array\xa0is often used to mean\xa0array data type, a kind of\xa0data type\xa0provided by most\xa0high-level programming languages\xa0that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time.

The data are often called nodes. The references are often called links or pointers. From here on, the words node and pointer will be used for these concepts.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20structure
11;What operations are typically performed on pointers in linked data structures?;Pointers in linked data structures are typically only dereferenced or compared for equality.;['In linked data structures, pointers are only\xa0dereferenced\xa0or compared for equality.
