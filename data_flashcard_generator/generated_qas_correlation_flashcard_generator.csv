In fact, it is very possible that there is a third factor involved.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation
2;What happens to two sets of data when they have a positive correlation?;They go up together.;['Correlation usually has one of two directions. These are positive or negative.

5;What is the range of values that a correlation coefficient can give, and what do the extreme values represent?;A correlation coefficient gives a number between -1 and 1. The extreme values, 1 and -1, represent strong correlation, while 0 represents no correlation.;"[""There are ways of making numbers show how strong the correlation is. These measurements are called correlation coefficients. The best known is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, sometimes denoted by  or its Greek equivalent . You put in data into a formula, and it gives you a number between -1 and 1. If the number is 1 or −1, then there is strong correlation. If the answer is 0, then there is no correlation. Another kind of correlation coefficient is Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.""]";https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation
6;What is an important consideration when interpreting the relationship between two correlated events?;That correlation does not necessarily imply causation, as other factors may be influencing the relationship.;['Correlation does not always mean that one thing causes the other (causation), because there might be something else that is at play.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation
7;What is an example of two events that are correlated but not directly causally linked?;Ice cream sales and shark attacks, as both increase when the temperature rises, but one does not cause the other.;['For example, on hot days people buy ice cream, and people also go to the beach where some are eaten by sharks. There is a correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks (they both go up as the temperature goes up in this case). But just because ice cream sales go up does not mean ice cream sales cause (causation) more shark attacks or vice versa.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation
8;Why do scientists and economists create isolated environments when testing their theories related to correlation?;To change only one factor at a time, where possible, in order to accurately determine causation.;['Because correlation does not imply causation, scientists, economists, etc. will test their theories by creating isolated environments where only one factor is changed (where this is possible). However, politicians, salesmen, news outlets and others often suggest that a particular correlation implies causation. This may be due to ignorance or a wish to persuade. Thus, a news report may attract attention by saying that people who consume a particular product more often have a particular health problem, implying a causation that could be actually due to something else.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation

37;In the context of rank correlation, what happens when a pair does not support the hypothesis, and how does it affect the overall correlation?;When a pair does not support the hypothesis, it means that the expected relationship between the two groups is not observed in that pair. This affects the overall correlation by reducing the percentage of data that supports the hypothesis, thus lowering the rank correlation coefficient.;['The analysis is done on pairs, a member of one group compared to a member of the other group. For example, the fastest runner in the study is a member of four pairs: (1,5), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9).  All four of these pairs support the hypothesis, because in each pair the runner from Group A is faster than the runner from Group B.  There are a total of 20 pairs, and 19 pairs support the hypothesis.  The only pair which does not support the hypothesis are the two runners with ranks 5 and 6, because in this pair, the runner from Group B had the faster time.  By the Kerby simple difference formula, 95% of the data support the hypothesis (19 of 20 pairs), and 5% do not support (1 of 20 pairs), so the rank correlation is r = .95 - .05 = .90.'];https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank%20correlation
