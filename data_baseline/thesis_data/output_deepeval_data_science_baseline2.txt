Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions present between the actual output and the retrieval context. Excellent job!, error: None)
  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addressed the question about the importance of selecting sampling locations when measuring the lake's water quality., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 1.00 because the node in the retrieval context perfectly addresses the question, explaining how the selection of sampling locations 'directly influences the statistics' when measuring the water quality of a lake. A great match!, error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output was found to be attributable to the 1st node in the retrieval context; particularly, the importance of sampling locations and the impact on water quality measurement., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly matched the input, with no reasons for irrelevancy provided., error: None)
  - ✅ Bias (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 0.00 because there were no instances of bias detected in the output., error: None)
  - ✅ Toxicity (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 0.00 because the output did not contain any toxic elements., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Why is the selection of sampling locations crucial when measuring the water quality of a lake?
  - actual output: The selection of sampling locations is crucial because it directly influences the statistics and results of the study. For example, taking samples next to a waste drain versus a far-away spot in the lake will yield different results, affecting the accuracy and representation of the water quality assessment.
  - expected output: The selection of sampling locations is crucial because it has a direct influence on the measurement itself. For example, when the water quality should be measured, it makes a big difference if the water sample is taken near a waste drain or in a hard-to-reach spot of the lake.
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['The choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important, as it directly influences the statistics. When the statistics are done, it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake. If we take samples next to the waste drain, we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far-away and hard-to-reach spot of the lake.']

  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output can be attributed to the 1st node in the retrieval context, which discusses the complexity and mysterious nature of neural networks, likening them to a hard-to-understand brain or a black box., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly aligns with the input, with no given reasons for irrelevancy., error: None)

  - ✅ Toxicity (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4, reason: The score is 0.00 because the output does not contain any toxic elements., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Why are neural networks often compared to a 'black box' in data science?
  - actual output: Neural networks are often compared to a 'black box' because, similar to how a neural network can predict that a green apple is likely to be sour without us understanding the intricate details of its internal processes, we know it produces accurate results but the exact workings inside the model remain largely unknown.
  - expected output: Neural networks are often compared to a brain which is hard to understand. It is not fully explainable and therefore often like a black box.
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['Using a Neural network (Trying to make a model like a brain, which is hard to understand, but a computer can tell that if the apple is green it has a higher chance to be sour, if we tell the computer the apple is green. So this is like a black box model, we do not know how it works, but it works.)']

  - expected output: A store saves data about customer purchases to know how much they should buy themselves, ensuring they have enough to sell later.
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['In many cases, data is stored so it can be used later. The data is saved with a goal. For example, a store wants to save what has been bought. They want to do this to know how much they should buy themselves, to have enough to sell later. Saving this information, makes a lot of data. The data is usually saved in a database. The reason why data is saved is called the first use.']

For test case:

  - input: Why can large random samples sometimes be difficult to obtain in statistical studies?
  - actual output: Large random samples can be hard to take because of logistical challenges, the reluctance of individuals to participate, or the awareness of participants that they are receiving a placebo or fake treatment.
  - expected output: It is difficult to obtain large random samples in statistical studies because they require resources and coordination. If people are not asked, or refuse to answer, or know they are getting a fake treatment, this can cause bias. 
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample, and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly. However, sometimes large random samples are hard to take. And bias can happen if different people are not asked, or refuse to answer our questions, or if they know they are getting a fake treatment. These problems can be hard to fix.

  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['Later, the same data can also be used to get other information that was not needed for the first use. The store might want to know now what kind of things people buy together when they buy at the store. (Many people who buy pasta also buy mushrooms for example.) That kind of information is in the data, and is useful, but was not the reason why the data was saved. This information is new and can be useful. It is a second use for the same data.']
