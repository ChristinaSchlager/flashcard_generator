1;Why might cross-disciplinary teams be essential in data science?;Cross-disciplinary teams are essential in data science because a data scientist is typically an expert in only one or two disciplines such as mathematics, statistics, or computer science, which necessitates collaboration to solve complex data problems effectively.;A person that does data science is called a data scientist. Data scientists solve complicated data problems using mathematics, statistics and computer science, although very good skill in these subjects are not required. However, a data scientist is most likely to be an expert in only one or two of these disciplines, meaning that cross disciplinary teams can be a key component of data science.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20science;Cross-disciplinary teams are key in data science because a data scientist is most likely an expert in only one or two disciplines, so combining expertise from different fields allows for better solutions to complicated data problems.;0,333333333;0,993573412;1;1;0,978969163;0,994742291;0,333333333;1;1;0,959554672;yes

4;Why do stores save information about purchases, and how does this influence their future business decisions?;Stores save information about purchases to understand how much they need to buy in the future, ensuring they have enough stock to meet customer demand. This strategic data collection helps in making informed inventory decisions.;In many cases, data is stored so it can be used later. The data is saved with a goal. For example, a store wants to save what has been bought. They want to do this to know how much they should buy themselves, to have enough to sell later. Saving this information, makes a lot of data. The data is usually saved in a database. The reason why data is saved is called the first use.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20mining;A store saves data about customer purchases to know how much they should buy themselves, ensuring they have enough to sell later.;0,6;0,953296295;1;1;0,919950811;0,792487703;0,666666664;1;1;0,893970311;yes
5;What is an example of how stores use data to understand customer buying patterns?;Stores analyze data to identify items that customers frequently purchase together, such as pasta and mushrooms, to better understand buying patterns and potentially enhance marketing strategies.;Later, the same data can also be used to get other information that was not needed for the first use. The store might want to know now what kind of things people buy together when they buy at the store. (Many people who buy pasta also buy mushrooms for example.) That kind of information is in the data, and is useful, but was not the reason why the data was saved. This information is new and can be useful. It is a second use for the same data.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20mining;An example is a store that originally saves purchase data to manage inventory but later repurposes it to discover that customers often buy pasta and mushrooms together, revealing valuable insights beyond the original goal.;0,5;0,958218886;1;1;0,923458693;0,564198006;0,499999999;1;1;0,822180152;yes

7;What role does prediction play in data mining?;In data mining, prediction is commonly involved to generate new information, although it often comes with uncertainty in the results.;For data, there a lot of different kinds of data mining for getting new information. Usually, prediction is involved. There is uncertainty in the predicted results. The following is based on the observation that there is a small green apple in which we can adjust our data in structural manner. Some of the kinds of data mining are:;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20mining;Prediction is commonly used in data mining as a method for extracting new information from data.

8;What is pattern recognition in the context of data mining?;Pattern recognition in data mining involves identifying similarities or patterns among data points in a database, often expressed as rules. For example, the rule 'Small -> green' suggests that small items, like small apples, are often green.;Pattern recognition (Trying to find similarities in the rows in the database, in the form of rules. Small -> green. (Small apples are often green));https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20mining;Pattern recognition tries to find similarities in the data rows, in orm of rules.

9;How can knowledge of one data attribute in a Bayesian network help predict another attribute?;In a Bayesian network, understanding one attribute, such as size, can help predict another related attribute, like colour, because the network models how different data attributes are connected and influence each other.;Using a Bayesian network (Trying to make something that can say how the different data attributes are connected/influence each other. The size and the colour are related. So if you know something about the size, you can guess the colour.);https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20mining;The Bayesian network tries to find data attributes which are connected with each other.

11;How does a classification tree help predict unknown characteristics of an object based on known attributes?;A classification tree uses known attributes of an object, such as size, color, and shininess, to predict unknown characteristics, like what the taste of an apple might be.;Using Classification tree (With all other knowledge trying to say what one other thing about the thing we are looking at will be. Here is an apple with a size, a colour and shininess, what will it taste like?);https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20mining;A classification tree is a model that predicts an attribute, like the taste of an apple, by splitting data based on other features such as size, color, and shininess.;1;0,909632334;1;1;0,964308833;0,841077208;0,444444444;1;0,5;0,923702717;no
12;What are the two main types of statistics mentioned, and what is their primary function?;The two main types of statistics mentioned are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics summarize data, while inferential statistics are used to make predictions.;"Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with collecting, organising, analysing, reading and presenting data. Descriptive statistics make summaries of data. Inferential statistics makes predictions. Statistics helps in the study of many other fields, such as science, medicine, economics, psychology, politics and marketing. Someone who works in statistics is called a statistician.

15;In statistics, what is the difference between a 'sample' and a 'population'?;A 'sample' refers to a subset of people chosen from the total 'population' to represent the whole. The sample consists of observable data, whereas the population includes all potential data, which is often not fully observable.;Before we can describe the world with statistics, we must collect data. The data that we collect in statistics are called measurements. After we collect data, we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement. For example, suppose that we want to find out how popular a certain TV show is. We can pick a group of people (called a sample) out of the total population of viewers. Then we ask each viewer in the sample how often they watch the show. The sample is data that one can see, and the population is data that one cannot see (assuming that not every viewer in the population are asked). For another example, if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure, we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;In statistics, a 'sample' is a group out of the entire 'population' that is observed and measured, while the 'population' refers to the entire group of interest, including individuals not directly observed or measured.;1;0,98908479;1;1;0,96066513;0,990166282;0,599999999;1;1;0,927484214;no
16;What is the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics?;Descriptive statistics are used to describe the data that can be seen, while inferential statistics are used to make predictions about data that cannot be seen.;Numbers that describe the data one can see are called descriptive statistics. Numbers that make predictions about the data one cannot see are called inferential statistics.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;The difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics is that descriptive statistics describe the data that is seen, while inferential statistics are used to make predictions about data that is not directly seen.;1;0,991495969;1;1;0,976668844;0,994167211;0,499999999;1;1;0,898948669;no
17;What is an example of a descriptive statistic related to a demographic group in the United States?;The average height of women in the United States is an example of a descriptive statistic.;Descriptive statistics involves using numbers to describe features of data. For example, the average height of women in the United States is a descriptive statistic: it describes a feature (average height) of a population (women in the United States).;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;The average height of women in the United States is an example of a descriptive statistic.;1;0,920890974;1;1;1;1;0,749999998;1;1;1;no
18;How does inferential statistics help biologists predict the size of animal offspring?;Inferential statistics allows biologists to create models predicting that offspring will likely be small if the parents were small, providing a more accurate prediction than random guessing.;Once the results have been summarized and described, they can be used for prediction. This is called inferential statistics. As an example, the size of an animal is dependent on many factors. Some of these factors are controlled by the environment, but others are by inheritance. A biologist might therefore make a model that says that there is a high probability that the offspring will be small in size—if the parents were small in size. This model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random. Testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those who are given a placebo.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;Inferential statistics helps biologists predict the size of animal offspring by allowing them to create models based on observed data, such as the size of the parents. These models can predict that offspring are likely to be small if the parents were small, providing a more accurate method of prediction than random guessing.;1;0,943168774;1;1;0,978702696;0,887532817;0,125;1;1;0,944310784;no
19;What is one common method used to collect statistical data as mentioned in the text?;One common method to collect statistical data is by conducting surveys, such as opinion polls.;Most often, we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments. For example, an opinion poll is one kind of survey. We pick a small number of people and ask them questions. Then, we use their answers as the data.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;One common method used to collect statistical data is by doing surveys, such as opinion polls.;1;0,963991018;1;1;0,997070762;0,999267691;0,666666664;1;1;0,997175395;no
20;Why is the selection of sampling locations crucial when measuring the water quality of a lake?;The selection of sampling locations is crucial because it directly influences the statistics and results of the study. For example, taking samples next to a waste drain versus a far-away spot in the lake will yield different results, affecting the accuracy and representation of the water quality assessment.;The choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important, as it directly influences the statistics. When the statistics are done, it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake. If we take samples next to the waste drain, we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far-away and hard-to-reach spot of the lake.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;The selection of sampling locations is crucial because it has a direct influence on the measurement itself. For example, when the water quality should be measured, it makes a big difference if the water sample is taken near a waste drain or in a hard-to-reach spot of the lake.;0,666666667;0,935532959;1;1;0,973282204;0,993320551;0,333333333;1;1;0,961979628;yes

22;What is a 'chance error' in statistics and when is it likely to occur?;A 'chance error' in statistics occurs when the samples used in a study are not representative of the real population, which is more likely to happen when there are very few samples.;If there are many samples, the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real population. If there are very few samples, however, they might be very different from what they are in the real population.  This error is called a chance error (see also Errors and residuals in statistics).;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;A 'chance error' in statistics refers to the error that arises when sample observations differ from the actual population characteristics. This type of error is more likely to occur when there are very few samples, making them less representative of the population.;1;0,979577413;1;1;0,966587531;0,841646883;0,333333333;1;1;0,908202469;no
23;Why is it important to choose individuals for samples randomly in statistical studies?;Choosing individuals randomly is important to avoid bias, ensuring the sample accurately represents the total population. If not chosen randomly, the samples might significantly differ from the actual characteristics of the total population, even if a large number of samples is taken.;The individuals for the samples need to be chosen carefully. Usually, they will be chosen randomly. If this is not the case, the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population. This is true even if a great number of samples is taken. This kind of error is called bias.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;Choosing individuals randomly for samples in statistical studies is important to avoid bias.

24;Why can large random samples sometimes be difficult to obtain in statistical studies?;Large random samples can be hard to take because of logistical challenges, the reluctance of individuals to participate, or the awareness of participants that they are receiving a placebo or fake treatment.;We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample, and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly. However, sometimes large random samples are hard to take. And bias can happen if different people are not asked, or refuse to answer our questions, or if they know they are getting a fake treatment. These problems can be hard to fix. See standard error for more.;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics;It is difficult to obtain large random samples in statistical studies because they require resources and coordination. If people are not asked, or refuse to answer, or know they are getting a fake treatment, this can cause bias. ;1;0,960614882;1;0,5;0,933151116;0,795787779;0,333333333;1;1;0,887150407;yes
